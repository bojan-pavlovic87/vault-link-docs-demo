# VaultLink Testing Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Client:** Synertec  
**Project:** VaultLink MVP AWS Rebuild  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive Testing Approach & Quality Assurance

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the testing strategy for VaultLink MVP to ensure high-quality, secure, and reliable payment processing platform. The strategy covers all testing levels from unit to production monitoring, with focus on payment-critical paths, security compliance, and mobile-first user experience.

**Key Testing Objectives:**
- 100% critical path coverage (payment flows, Prism integration)
- Zero critical/high security vulnerabilities before production
- <500ms P95 API response times validated under load
- 99.9% Prism message delivery reliability
- PCI SAQ A compliance validation
- Mobile performance on 3G networks validated

---

## Testing Principles

### Quality Gates

**No deployment proceeds without:**
1. All unit tests passing (>90% code coverage)
2. All integration tests passing
3. Security scans clean (no critical/high vulnerabilities)
4. Performance benchmarks met
5. Acceptance criteria validated by PO

### Shift-Left Approach

- Testing starts at design phase (testability reviews)
- Developers write tests before/alongside code (TDD encouraged)
- Automated tests run on Pull Requests / merges (CI/CD pipeline)
- Security scanning integrated into development workflow

### Risk-Based Prioritization

**Critical (Must Test Thoroughly):**
- Payment processing and Stripe integration
- Multi-tenant data isolation
- Prism message delivery
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption

**High (Test Extensively):**
- Statement viewing and calculations
- Document management
- Query submission workflows
- Mobile responsive UI
- Performance under load

**Medium (Test Adequately):**
- Admin configuration
- Monitoring dashboards
- Backup/restore procedures
- Error messaging and logging

---

## Testing Levels

### 1. Unit Testing

**Scope:** Individual functions, methods, components in isolation

**Frontend (Angular):**
- **Framework:** Jasmine + Karma
- **Coverage Target:** >80% code coverage
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Component logic (TypeScript)
  - Service methods (API calls, state management)
  - Pipes and filters
  - Form validation logic
  - Utility functions

**Backend (.NET):**
- **Framework:** xUnit + Moq (mocking)
- **Coverage Target:** >85% code coverage
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Domain logic (business rules)
  - Data validation
  - Payment calculations (aging, amounts)
  - Stripe Connect integration logic
  - Prism message formatting
  - Lambda handler functions

**Best Practices:**
- Use test doubles (mocks, stubs) for external dependencies
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Keep tests fast (<100ms per test)
- Run on every code commit (pre-commit hooks)


---

### 2. Integration Testing

**Scope:** Component interactions, API contracts, database operations

**API Integration Tests:**
- **Framework:** xUnit + WebApplicationFactory (ASP.NET Core)
- **Focus Areas:**
  - API Gateway  Lambda integration
  - Lambda  DynamoDB CRUD operations
  - Lambda  SQS message publishing
  - Lambda  S3 read/write operations
  - Stripe Connect API calls (test mode)
  - Cognito authentication flows

**Database Integration Tests:**
- **Framework:** LocalStack or DynamoDB Local
- **Focus Areas:**
  - DynamoDB query patterns validation
  - GSI query performance
  - Data serialization/deserialization
  - Optimistic locking and concurrency
  - TTL expiration behavior

**Message Queue Integration:**
- **Framework:** LocalStack SQS
- **Focus Areas:**
  - SQS message publishing
  - Lambda SQS trigger processing
  - Dead-letter queue routing
  - Message retry logic
  - Prism delivery function end-to-end

**Best Practices:**
- Use containerized local AWS services (LocalStack)
- Test against real AWS in dev environment for critical paths
- Validate API contracts with schema validation
- Test idempotency for critical operations
- Clean up test data after each test

---

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

**Scope:** Complete user workflows from UI to backend

**Framework:** Cypress

**Critical User Journeys:**

**Journey 1: Anonymous Payment Flow**
1. User scans QR code / enters reference number
2. System displays statement with aging breakdown
3. User selects documents to pay
4. User enters payment amount (full or partial)
5. System redirects to Stripe payment form
6. User completes payment
7. System displays confirmation and receipt
8. System sends message to Prism via SQS
9. User receives email confirmation

**Journey 2: Query Submission**
1. User accesses statement
2. User selects invoice to query
3. User selects query reason or enters custom text
4. System submits query
5. System displays confirmation
6. System sends query notification to Prism

**Journey 3: Admin Configuration**
1. Admin logs in via Cognito
2. Admin navigates to customer configuration
3. Admin updates branding (logo, colors)
4. System saves to S3
5. System invalidates CloudFront cache
6. Changes reflected on customer-facing site

**Test Environments:**
- **Dev:** Continuous E2E tests on every PR merge
- **Staging:** Full E2E regression suite before prod deployment
- **Production:** Smoke tests post-deployment

**Best Practices:**
- Run E2E tests in headless mode for CI/CD
- Use data-testid attributes for stable selectors
- Implement retry logic for flaky network operations
- Record videos on test failures for debugging
- Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Test on real mobile devices (iOS, Android)

---

### 4. Contract Testing

**Framework:** Pact or OpenAPI schema validation

**Contracts to Validate:**

**Frontend  Backend API:**

- Error response formats
- Authentication headers

**Backend  Stripe Connect:**
- Payment intent creation
- Webhook event formats
- Connected account management

**Backend  Prism (TBD):**
- Message format validation
- Authentication mechanism
- Acknowledgment/error responses

**Best Practices:**
- Generate API clients from OpenAPI specs
- Version API contracts
- Run contract tests on both consumer and provider
- Break builds on contract violations

---

### 5. Performance Testing

**Scope:** Response times, throughput, scalability

**Tools:** Apache JMeter, Gatling, or Artillery

**Performance Benchmarks:**

| Metric | Target | Test Scenario |
|--------|--------|---------------|

| API Response (Payment) | <500ms P95 | 500 concurrent users |
| Page Load Time | <3s (3G mobile) | Initial load + assets |
| Time to Interactive | <5s (3G) | First meaningful paint |
| Lambda Cold Start | <2s | .NET Lambda with provisioned concurrency |
| DynamoDB Query | <10ms P95 | Statement retrieval by PK |
| SQS Message Processing | <5s | Prism delivery end-to-end |

**Load Test Scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Normal Load**
- 500 concurrent users

- Duration: 30 minutes
- Ramp-up: 5 minutes

**Scenario 2: Peak Load**
- 1000 concurrent users
- Same mix as normal load
- Duration: 15 minutes
- Ramp-up: 3 minutes

**Scenario 3: Spike Test**
- 0  500 users in 1 minute
- Sustained for 10 minutes
- Validate auto-scaling

**Scenario 4: Soak Test**
- 300 concurrent users
- Duration: 4 hours
- Detect memory leaks and resource exhaustion

**Monitoring During Tests:**
- Lambda invocation count and duration
- API Gateway 4xx/5xx errors
- DynamoDB consumed read/write capacity
- CloudFront cache hit ratio
- Application response times
- Infrastructure costs

**Best Practices:**
- Run performance tests in dedicated AWS account

## Test Data Management

### Data Requirements

**Synthetic Test Data:**
- Customer configurations (10 test customers)
- Statements with varying aging buckets
- Documents (invoices, PODs) in PDF format
- Payment transactions (successful, failed, partial)
- Query submissions with different statuses

**Data Generation:**
- Faker.js for realistic customer names, addresses
- Custom scripts for financial data (amounts, dates)
- Anonymized production data (masked PII)

**Data Refresh:**

- Staging environment: Weekly refresh before UAT
- Production: No test data (real data only)

### Multi-Tenancy Test Data

**Critical:** Test data isolation between customers

**Validation:**
- Customer A cannot access Customer B data
- API calls with Customer A token return only A's data
- Queries filtered by tenant ID at database level
- Admin users scoped to their customer only
